   â€¢	The distribution of Closed PnL (Profit and Loss) shows high variability across all sentiment categories.\
   â€¢	Outliers are present in every sentiment phase, suggesting that individual trades can lead to significant profits or losses regardless of market sentiment.\
   â€¢	However, the median PnL remains close to zero for all sentiment levels, implying no consistent profitability trend driven solely by sentiment.\
   â€¢	This indicates that trader performance depends more on individual strategy rather than market mood alone.

##### **2. Average PnL vs. Market Sentiment**

   â€¢	The average daily PnL remains centered near zero across sentiments, with a few traders achieving high profits and some suffering losses.\
   â€¢	Slightly higher positive outliers during Extreme Greed and Fear phases suggest potential for large wins when volatility is high.\
   â€¢	Overall, sentiment extremes correlate with higher risk and variability, but not necessarily consistent profitability.

##### **3. Profit Rate vs. Market Sentiment**

   â€¢	Median profit rate is highest during Extreme Greed (~0.35) and slightly lower in Fear and Neutral conditions.\
   â€¢	During Extreme Fear, the median profit rate is the lowest, showing traders tend to perform worse in highly fearful markets.\
   â€¢	The upper quartile reaching near 1.0 across sentiments indicates that some traders manage to stay consistently profitable regardless of sentiment.

##### **4. Buy Ratio vs. Market Sentiment**

   â€¢	Traders show a balanced buy-sell behavior overall.\
   â€¢	Median buy ratios hover around 0.45â€“0.5 for most sentiments, indicating no strong bias toward buying or selling.\
   â€¢	A slight increase in the buy ratio during Fear suggests traders may be more inclined to open long positions expecting a rebound.

##### **5. Number of Trades vs. Market Sentiment**

   â€¢	The number of trades is highest during Greed and Fear phases, followed by Extreme Greed.\
   â€¢	Neutral and Extreme Fear conditions show significantly fewer trades.\
   â€¢	This implies traders are most active when emotions are strong (Greed or Fear), driven by volatility and perceived opportunity.

##### **6. Win Rate vs. Market Sentiment**
   \  <img width="872" height="585" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-31 180434" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b1d6563-1603-42ae-ad35-122fb0b02383" />\
   â€¢	The win rate is highest during Extreme Greed (~47%), followed by Fear (~42%).\
   â€¢	It declines during Greed, Neutral, and is lowest during Extreme Fear (~36%).\
   â€¢	Traders appear to perform best in optimistic (greedy) conditions, possibly due to stronger upward momentum and risk-taking.

##### **7. Average Trade Size vs. Market Sentiment**
   \  <img width="870" height="586" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-31 180441" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f676b1b5-3fd7-450d-9bf2-30de35100499" />\
   â€¢	Average trade size peaks during Fear ~7800, suggesting higher capital deployment during uncertain timesâ€”possibly an attempt to capitalize on volatility.\
   â€¢	The lowest trade size occurs during Extreme Greed ~3100, indicating cautious trading despite positive sentiment.\
   â€¢	This pattern may suggest risk-averse scaling during overconfident markets and aggressive positioning during fearful ones.

### **ðŸ§  Key Insights**
   â€¢	Trader activity and performance are sentiment-sensitive: High emotional phases (Fear and Greed) lead to more trading activity and wider PnL variation.\
   â€¢	Extreme Fear correlates with poor performance, while Extreme Greed yields better win rates and profit ratios.\
   â€¢	Fearful markets attract larger trade sizes, suggesting traders perceive them as high-risk, high-reward opportunities.\
   â€¢	No sentiment guarantees consistent profit, as medians remain near zero â€” reflecting the unpredictable nature of trading even in clear sentiment trends.

### **ðŸ“ˆ Conclusion**
##### **Market sentiment influences trading behavior more than trading outcomes.**\
   â€¢	During Greed, traders are more active and moderately successful.\
   â€¢	During Fear, traders take bigger risks but experience more volatility in results.\
   â€¢	Extreme emotions (either direction) lead to higher variability, emphasizing the importance of risk management and discipline in sentiment-driven markets.
